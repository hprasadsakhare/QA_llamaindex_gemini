# Q&A System with Gemini AI and LlamaIndex

## Project Overview
This project implements an advanced Question Answering system that leverages Google's Gemini AI and LlamaIndex for intelligent document processing and retrieval. The system is designed to provide accurate, context-aware answers to user queries by processing and understanding document content at a deep semantic level.

## How It Works
The system follows a sophisticated pipeline:

1. **Document Processing**
   - Documents are loaded and preprocessed
   - Text is split into manageable chunks
   - Each chunk is analyzed for semantic meaning

2. **Vector Embedding**
   - Text chunks are converted into vector embeddings using Google's embedding models
   - These embeddings capture semantic relationships between text segments

3. **Indexing**
   - Documents are indexed in a vector store for efficient retrieval
   - The index enables fast similarity searches

4. **Query Processing**
   - User questions are processed and converted to embeddings
   - Relevant document chunks are retrieved based on semantic similarity
   - The Gemini AI model generates context-aware answers

5. **Response Generation**
   - The system combines retrieved information with the question
   - Gemini AI generates a comprehensive, accurate response
   - Responses are formatted for easy reading
